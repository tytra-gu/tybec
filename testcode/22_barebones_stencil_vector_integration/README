A barebones example to test integration of stencils with vectorization

ver 1::
+ No stencils at all, just testing vectorization one level lower then before
  - before, I would replicate kernelTop V times
  - now, I need to replicate all top level nodes _inside_ kernelTop V times
+ IR code as testcode0, ver0 
  
ver 2::
+ Now introducing stencils
+ IR code same as testcode8, ver 3

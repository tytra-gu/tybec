=======================

This is based on zeroth test-case for TyBEC-17. 
It is a synthetic, barebones example to get the entire flow working (all the way to rtl and opencl-wrapper generation).
This particular extension has multi-cycle (stub) instructions to test split/merge integration.

FORTRAN has not been written. 
TODO: Do fortran so that can test with  Wim's tool.

#BUILD & RUN (C and Fortran)
#------------
#0. cd ./c (./fortran)
#1. scons
#2. ./barebones.exe

VERSIONS
------------
// ver1 //
+ Introducing a multi-cycle iterative "pow" function into the testcode #0 barebones example.
+ "pow" presumed to be imlemented by a stub (peforming addition) by the backend

// ver2 //
+ barebones of barebones
+ just one kernel with one (pow) instruction to debug multi-cycle unit

// ver 3 //
+ Copy of ver1, with split and merge now (using [pndmap N] syntax)
+ Redundant second input added to kernel_B for testing
(+ Not tested with multiple outputs in pndmap unit though)
+ Different values of pndmap tested.

// ver 4 //
+ Modified DFG, to have parallel DFG paths, with one path having stalls (due to multi-cycle stubs) and the other path not.
+ Verified for both multi-cycle nodes, pndmap multi-cycle nodes

// ver 5 (not complete)//
+ Further modifications to add select path and see if that fails too
+ LEFT INCOMPLETE, I debugged this issue inside 2dshallowwater example

The oclnn2 folder contains the Iris network implementation (developed to run on the FPGA) during this project. 

The Iris-Neural-Network folder contains the TensorFlow reference implementation that I was trying to mimic - it can be found online at https://github.com/EdoVaira/Iris-Neural-Network.

The pipeExperiment folder contains the scripts necessary to generate the producer-consumer kernels (+ a script that compiles them with aoc) and then extract usage data information from the reports generated by the compiler.

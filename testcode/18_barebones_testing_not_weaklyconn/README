=======================

This is based on zeroth test-case for TyBEC-17. 
It is a synthetic, barebones example to get the entire flow working (all the way to rtl and opencl-wrapper generation).

This particular extension is for testing functions that are NOT internally weakly connected. Until this testcode this was a requirement, I want to remove it.

FORTRAN has not been written. 
TODO: Do fortran so that can test with  Wim's tool.
